#  Project Issue Management Workflow â€“ EduBand



##  GitHub Workflow

For EduBand development, we actively utilized **GitHub Issues** to manage task distribution and track project progress efficiently.

- Tasks were documented as **GitHub Issues**, assigned individually to team members.
- **Labels** such as `bug`, `feature`, `frontend`, `backend`, and `urgent` were consistently used for categorization.
- Each team member was assigned approximately **10 distinct issues**, identified clearly by name.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)** were **mandatory** for merging any work into the main branch.
- A minimum of **one peer review approval** was required before any PR could be merged.

---

##  Review Procedure

- Issues were opened with **detailed checklists** and descriptions of required work.
- Developers **self-assigned** or were assigned to specific issues.
- A **Pull Request (PR)** was created linking back to the corresponding issue  
  *(e.g., `Resolves #22`)*.
- A **different team member reviewed** the code, provided feedback if needed, and approved the PR.
- Upon approval, the PR was merged following **branch protection rules**.

##  Weekly Tracking Statistics

-  A total of **30 issues** were opened and closed during the project lifecycle.
-  The **average issue resolution time** was approximately **1.8 days**.
-  At final delivery, **no open issues remained**; the repository was **fully clean**.
