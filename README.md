🎓 EduBand – Wearable Attention Monitoring and Feedback System
EduBand is a wearable device designed to assist students who struggle with attention loss during online classes or long study sessions. The device monitors focus levels in real time using movement, heart rate, and behavioral attention signals (such as stillness, unusual hand movements, or heart rate anomalies). When attention loss is detected, the device provides vibrational feedback to help students regain focus.

In addition, EduBand is integrated with a mobile application that provides daily and weekly reports for students. Guardians and academic counselors can also receive weekly performance summaries in PDF format, allowing for remote follow-up and progress tracking.

This system was developed as part of an academic software project to simulate real-world product development and planning. It prioritizes scalability, real-time feedback, and user-centered reporting using modern technologies.
